Greetings!

I prefer hard cider to beer, enjoy a nice glass of wine that tastes good but will never be pretentious about label or country of origin, and favor a refreshing homemade smoothie over all of them.  I am super excited that we are currently experiencing a boom in seltzer water popularity and fun flavors!  Could we be living through a seltzer-water market bubble?  What would happen if the bubble ever birsts?  That sounds refreshing, to be honest.  But the reality might be more bitter to swllow.  Anyway, I am excited to see where we go from here.  This file is most definitely changed from what was here before.  More later.
